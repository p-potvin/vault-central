# Favorites Central

A simple and lightweight browser extension designed to instantly save your favorite videos and links while browsing. By utilizing a quick keyboard shortcut, you can effortlessly capture the video or link directly under your mouse cursor and store it in a neatly organized dashboard.

## Features

- **Quick Capture:** Use a designated keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+S`) to instantly save details about the video or link currently under your mouse.
- **Automatic Thumbnails:** Attempts to capture the current frame of the video to display as a thumbnail in your dashboard.
- **Easy Access Dashboard:** Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open a dedicated dashboard where all your saved items are listed.
- **Manage Saved Items:** Easily review, open in a new tab, or delete any saved videos directly from your dashboard.

## How It Works

- When you press `Ctrl+Shift+S`, the script evaluates the element directly under your cursor.
- If it detects a `<video>` tag or a link (`<a>`), it extracts the URL and attempts to capture a snapshot frame.
- All extracted data is stored locally in your browser using the extensions storage API.
- Opening the extension loads a dashboard to browse all your favorite videos and links.

## Installation Instructions (Local/Developer Mode)

> **Note**: Because this extension relies on the `browser.*` Promise-based namespace and specifies `"scripts"` in a Manifest V3 background configuration, it is natively structured for **Mozilla Firefox**. 
> To test in Google Chrome or Edge without polyfills natively, you may need to update `"background": {"scripts": ...}` to `"background": {"service_worker": "background.js"}` in `manifest.json`, and substitute `browser.` calls with `chrome.`.

### Installing on Mozilla Firefox (Recommended)

1. Open Firefox and type `about:debugging` in the address bar, then press **Enter**.
2. Click on **This Firefox** in the left sidebar.
3. Under the **Temporary Extensions** section, click the **Load Temporary Add-on...** button.
4. Navigate to the folder where you saved this project (`favorites_central`).
5. Select any file in the directory (such as `manifest.json`) and click **Open**.
6. The extension is now successfully installed. Pin its icon in your toolbar to easily access the dashboard later!

### Installing on Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge

## Publishing Privately

If you want to distribute this extension to your devices or a limited group of users without making it publicly searchable on add-on stores, follow these instructions:

### Firefox (Unlisted Extension)
1. Go to the [Firefox Add-on Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/).
2. Click **Submit a New Add-on**.
3. Select **On your own** (this is the option to keep it private/unlisted, requiring Mozilla signing but not a public listing).
4. Zip the contents of your `favorites_central` directory (ensure `manifest.json` is at the root of the `.zip` file).
5. Upload the `.zip` file.
6. Once it passes automated review, you can download the signed `.xpi` file.
7. You can now install this `.xpi` file directly in Firefox on any machine.

### Google Chrome (Private Publishing)
1. Go to the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole).
2. Pay the one-time $5 developer registration fee if you haven't already.
3. Click **New Item** and upload a `.zip` file containing your extension.
4. Fill out the required store listing details (Privacy policy, description, icons).
5. Under the **Visibility** section in your dashboard, select **Private** or **Unlisted**. 
   - **Private** means only specific Google accounts you invite can see and install it.
   - **Unlisted** means anyone with the direct link can install it, but it won't appear in search results.
6. Submit for review. Once approved, share the link with your allowed users.
