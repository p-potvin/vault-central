# 🎯 Vault Central Development Roadmap (VaultWares Standards)

## 🛡️ Phase 1: Core Standard & Cleanup
- [x] **Naming Consistency**: Rename \src/components/Dashboard.tsx\ to \src/components/VaultDashboard.tsx\ per [instructions.md](.github/instructions.md).
- [x] **Redundant Purge**: Manually delete \Dashboard-v4.tsx\, \Dashboard.tsx-v2\, \Dashboard.tsx-v3\, and other versioned artifacts.
- [x] **Type Safety**: Purged \any\ from pipelines and updated schemas to include 15+ metadata fields.
- [x] **Theme Logic**: Align Dashboard theme logic with [STYLE.md](.github/STYLE.md) (Skins 1-9 light/dark mapping).

## ⌨️ Phase 2: Input & Interaction (AGENT.md Alignment)
- [x] **Shortcut ALT+X**: Implement "Capture under mouse" logic in [content.ts](src/scripts/content.ts).
    - [x] Calculate "closest to mouse pointer" element (Bresenham-lite search).
    - [x] Handle silent hidden tab creation for m3u8 interception.
- [x] **Shortcut ALT+C**: Verify command mapping to open the [VaultDashboard.tsx](src/components/VaultDashboard.tsx).

## 📊 Phase 3: Dashboard UI/UX (VaultWares Design) [COMPLETED]
- [x] **Header Refinement**:
    - [x] Ensure VaultWares logo and link are present.
    - [x] Implement the "Secure Media Vault" sub-header.
    - [x] Add clear toggle icon for sidebar (Hamburger Menu instead of duplicate Shield).
    - [x] Flatten header styling (removed floating rounded corners and hover effect).
- [x] **Side-Panel**:
    - [x] Verify "Group By Hostname" as default.
    - [x] Implement "View Types" slider and state initialization via localStorage.
    - [x] Add explicit "UI Theme" dropdown selector to replace hard-to-find toggle.
- [x] **Filtering & Sorting**:
    - [x] Implement universal filter across all metadata fields.
    - [x] Implement multi-field sorting with ASC/DESC toggle.
    - [x] Align search bar inputs and layout sizing.
- [x] **Grid & Pagination**:
    - [x] Implement Pagination logic per section with \lucide-react\ Chevron icons.
    - [x] Implement Infinite Scrolling (50 section limit per load).
    - [x] Adjust visible items count to accurately reflect active pagination state.
    - [x] Adjust Card Heights on specific view settings (preventing excessive vertical empty space).
    - [x] Details view: Enforce proper padding and minimum height for rows.

## 🎥 Phase 4: Item Behavior & Player [COMPLETED]
- [x] **Hover Feedback**:
    - [x] Implement thumbnail hover effect (Overlay, scanning animation, play preview).
    - [x] Internalize duration/meta into thumbnail (Target-lock style corners).
    - [x] Bottom-right duration badge.
- [x] **Action Icons**:
    - [x] Top-left: Edit Metadata (Internalized to Thumb). Hide on List views.
    - [x] Top-right: Delete Item (Internalized to Thumb). Hide on List views.
- [~] **Prop Player**:
    - [x] Centered modal (non-fullscreen).
    - [x] Autoplay/Controls.
    - [x] "Hidden Tab Refresh" for expired m3u8 links.
- [x] **Data Formatting & Fallbacks**:
    - [x] Cap rendering of all fractional numbers/decimals to 2 decimal places.
    - [x] Add SVG graphic fallback for broken/missing thumbnail images across cards.
- [x] **Tab Management**:
    - [x] Enforce singleton tab (prevent opening duplicate dashboards).
    - [x] Automatically refresh the data view on regaining visibility / tab focus.

## 🧠 Phase 5: Vault Intelligence (Advanced Previews) [COMPLETED]
- [x] **Binary Storage**: Dexie.js (IndexedDB) for storing high-fidelity preview Blobs.
- [x] **Offscreen Processor**: FFmpeg WASM implementation via \chrome.offscreen\.
- [x] **YouTube-style Preview**: 10 chunks of 2s muted WebM playback on hover.
- [x] **Automated Processing**: Background job triggered immediately on save.
- [x] **Fault Tolerance**: Manual recovery job triggered on hover if >30s elapsed since save.
- [x] **Theatrical Player**: Immersive video player with "Light Dimmer" (Palette icon).
- [x] **Browser Sync**: Multi-device state syncing (Firefox/Chrome APIs) [Metadata Only].

## 🔒 Phase 6: Security & Privacy (PIN System) [COMPLETED]
- [x] **Proton-style PIN**: Optional 4 or 6-digit PIN system.
- [x] **Secure Popup**: Rounded 4/6 input boxes with automatic transition and focus.
- [x] **Persistent Lock**: Memory-only database loading until authenticated.
- [x] **DevTools Hardening**: AES-256 encryption for IndexedDB Blobs using PIN as salt.
- [x] **In-Memory Logic**: \getSavedVideos\ logic blocked by \isVaultLocked()\ check.
- [x] **Idle Timeout**: Dropdown configuration (10m, 30m, 1h, 2h, Never).
- [x] **Locker UI**: Visual "Vault Unlocked" vs "Authenticating" states in popup.

## 🔔 Phase 7: Site Injections & Notifications [COMPLETED]
- [x] **Sync Indicators**: Green "Cloud-Heart" icon injected into thumbnails/links of saved items.
- [x] **Capture Toast**: Notification when starting capture via Alt+X (with spinner).
- [x] **Contextual Metadata**: In-DOM extraction of author, views, and tags during capture.
- [x] **Success/Failure Toasts**: Interactive, translucent notifications with security-focused messaging.
- [x] **Real-time Updates**: MutationObserver automatically updates indicators when site content scrolls/reloads.

## NEXT STEPS
- [x] Fix database wipe issue: The database gets wiped when saving an item while the dashboard is locked. It should allow adding items even if locked.
- [x] Fix heart indicator position: The heart indicator (from Phase 7) is currently positioned under the cursor when receiving a callback, but the user might have moved. It needs to be tied to the original item.
- [x] Notification stacking: Implement a system to stack notifications for multiple requests, with a limit of 10 concurrent requests. Notifications should disappear when resolved.
- [x] Button styling (Sync enabled): When sync is enabled, the button should be fully colored (like on hover but without dashed border). On hover, add the dashed border.
- [x] Details view UI (view mode == 1): 
    - [x] Make main item taller (60px).
    - [x] Fix "V-ID" badge centering.

## 🧹 Phase 8: Optimization & Refactoring [COMPLETED]
- [x] **Constant Extraction**: Centralized hardcoded strings and config in `src/lib/constants.ts`.
- [x] **Redundant Deletion**: (Manual) Cleaned up `.js` artifacts and temporary test scripts.
- [x] **Storage Hardening**: Switched to `STORAGE_KEYS` across `storage-vault` and `background`.
- [x] **Type Validation**: Implemented Zod schema parsing in storage retrieval for data integrity.
- [x] **Dashboard Singleton**: Hardened singleton logic using both URL and stored Tab ID.

## 🔮 Phase 9: Future Vault Features
- [ ] **Vault Portability**: Export/Import JSON logic.
- [ ] **Multi-Type Support**: Music, Torrents, and Bookmarks.
